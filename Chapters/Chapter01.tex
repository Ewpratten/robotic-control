It is probably safe to assume that you, the reader, are in a similar situation to me in mid 2019. 
Wanting to write high quality code to control a robot, and take a leap away from the "safe environment" given to you.

For me, this was during my work on \emph{FIRST} Robotics Competition (FRC) team 5024, \emph{Raider Robotics}. I got tired of 
the new-programmer-friendly environment and libraries that thousands of other teams were using, and wanted to 
set my team apart from the rest. This paper (or book. I still haven't decided what to call it) will cover 
what I have learned, and various interesting concepts you can use to set your robotics control software apart from 
others. Most importantly: I will try to explain everything at a much easier to understand level than more advanced
papers like \citeauthor{tylerveness:2020}'s ``\emph{Controls Engineering in the FIRST Robotics Competition}'' \citep{tylerveness:2020}
(A great resource for people with strong math skills)
